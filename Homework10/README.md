# The problem

Networking

Create an implementation of Gomoku (Five in a row) that allows remote players to start or join games. The application will contain two parts (create a project for each one):

The server is responsible with the game management and mediating the players.
The client will communicate with the server, sending it commands such as: create or join a game, submit a move, etc.

# NOTE
I implemented the TIC TAC TOE game (instead of Gomoku). The course teacher was informed about this aspect and agreed with it (without any penalties).


## Tasks
  * :smile: Implement functionalities of the game, using the classes Game, Board, Player, etc.
  * :smile: The clients will send to the server commands such as: create game, join game, submit move, etc.
  * :smile: The server is responsible with the game management and mediating the players.
  * ðŸ˜•: The games will be played under time control (blitz) with each player having the same amount of time at the beginning of the game. If a player's time runs out, the game is lost.
