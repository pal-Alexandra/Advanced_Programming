# The problem

REST Services

Continue the application created at the previous lab integrating the following functionalities: implement REST services needed to comunicate with the server side data (CRUD).

# NOTE
I don't communicate with any database.


## Tasks (Compulsory)
  * :smile: Create a Spring Boot project that will contain the REST services for comunicating with the server data.
  * :smile: Create a REST controller containing a method for:
     * :smile: obtaining the list of the registered players, via a HTTP GET request.
  * :smile: Test your service using the browser and/or Postman.
  
## Tasks (Homework)
  * :smile: Create REST services for:
    * :smile: adding a new player, via a HTTP POST request.
    * :smile: modifying the name of a player, via a HTTP PUT request.
    * :smile: deleting a player, via a HTTP DELETE request.
  * :smile: Create a REST service for obtaining the games that were recorded by the server.
  * :smile: Create a simple client application that invokes the services above, using the support offered by Spring Boot. (!NOTE: I get errors for PUT and POST requests)
