This folder contains the solution for homework exercices from the second laboratory. Solved/ unsolved tasks are checkmarked (:smile: / :confused:).

# The problem
An instance of the "Best Route Problem" consists of locations and roads. Locations may be cities, airports, gas stations, etc.

Two locations may be connected by a road, or not. Roads may be highways, express, country, etc.

Each location has a name, type and x, y coordinates (assume that the locations are placed in a cartesian coordinate system).

Each road has a type, length and a speed limit. The length of a road should not be less than the euclidian distance between the location coordinates.

We consider the problem of determining the "best" route from one location to another.

## Homework tasks
  * :smile: Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Location, Road;
The location and road types will be implemented as enums;
  * :smile: Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters;
  * :smile: The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes;
  * :smile: Create and print on the screen various objects of the two classes.
