## General info
This folder contains the solution for homework exercices from the third laboratory. Solved/ unsolved tasks are checkmarked (:smile: / :confused:).

# The problem
A social network contains persons and companies, each of them identifiable by unique names.

In this network there are relationships of the following types: person-to-person (if they know each other, how?), and person-to-company (if the person works for that company, on what position?).

There may be various types of "specialized" persons in the network, such as programmers or designers.

## Homework tasks
* :smile: Create the complete model: Person, Programmer, Designer, Company. All persons have a birth date. Each class must have at least one specific property, that others don't have (be creative).
* :smile: Each person will contain a Map defining the relathionships to other persons or companies.
* :smile: Create the Network class containing a List of identifiable nodes.
* :smile: Create a method that computes the importance of a node in the network, as the number of its connections to other nodes.
* :smile: Create a network object containing persons, companies and relationships and print it on the screen. When printing the network, the nodes must be ordered according to their importance.


### Demo
This pictures shows the network I created.
