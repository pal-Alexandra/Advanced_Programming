# The problem
The Student-Project Allocation Problem

An instance of this problem consists of students and projects. Each student has a list of projects that are admissible.

A matching is a set of pairs (student, project) such that each student is assigned to at most one project and each project is assigned to at most one student. 
We consider the problem of creating a maximum cardinality matching between students and projects.

## Tasks
  * :smile: Create a class that describes the problem;
  * :smile: Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the students that have a number of preferences lower than the average number of preferences;
  * :smile: Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for students and projects;
  * :smile: Create a Greedy algorithm in order to solve the problem.
